UCLA NLP Seminar
===
I co-organize the UCLA NLP Seminar Series, a seminar where we invite leading researchers in NLP to share their research. You can explore the current upcoming featured talks [here](https://uclanlp.github.io/nlp-seminar/). 

Open Office Hours

Mentorship from my collaborators ([Hritik Bansal](https://sites.google.com/view/hbansal), [Xiao Liu](https://xxxiaol.github.io/), [Gantavya Bhatt](https://sites.google.com/view/gbhatt/), [Tanmay Parekh](https://tanmayparekh.github.io/)) has been invaluable in shaping my journey, helping me grow both personally and professionally. Now, I'm committed to giving back to the community through 1:1 sessions. If youâ€™d like to chat about research, grad school applications or feedback on essays, please fill out this [form](https://forms.gle/RqpiK85fBZAQ6U4YA).

Grad School Mentorship
===
I am always happy to help with grad school applications. I have personal experience in MS CS and PhD(AI/ML) applications only. I would be limited in capability to mentor for other grad school programs (like MEng. or other niche programs). However, feel free to reach out using this [form](https://forms.gle/RqpiK85fBZAQ6U4YA) and I would be happy to help you!

Here are some resources that I found to be helpful during my grad school applications - [Shaily Bhatt's Repository of Resources](https://github.com/shaily99/advice?tab=readme-ov-file), [PhD Applications FAQ by Maria Antoniak (Cornell)](https://maria-antoniak.github.io/2020/11/27/phd-applications.html), [Vlog on how to find CS Programs with CSRankings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOSl3xPmHiQ), [Application Fee Waivers](https://github.com/KaiserWhoLearns/CS-PhD-Application-fee-waivers), [Compilation of CS PhD SOPs](https://cs-sop.notion.site/CS-PhD-Statements-of-Purpose-df39955313834889b7ac5411c37b958d). 

Research Mentorship
===
Typically, if you are an undergrad or MS student at UCLA, hiring for our lab is usually through my advisor. You can express your interest using this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd2EKTn7vMy6h_Uvb7bAIvkl4cGkSH3uJvoED84yTaFjKcx9w/viewform) and my advisor or another PhD student would reach out if your interests align.
