This is Ashima, a PhD student at UCLA CS advised by [Prof. Saadia Gabriel](https://saadia-gabriel.github.io/). 

I actively collaborate with Prof. Nanyun Peng, Prof. Kai-Wei Chang and Prof. Tom Hartvigsen. Additionally, I work with [datacomp](https://www.datacomp.ai/) for data curation with Prof. Ludwig Schmidt. 

My research focuses on post-training data recipes and training paradigms for improving the reasoning and alignment capabilities of LLMs. I am currently exploring data recipes for to develop general-purpose reasoning models and software engineering agents.
