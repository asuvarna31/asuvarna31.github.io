This is Ashima, a Research Associate at UCLA advised by [Prof. Nanyun Peng](https://vnpeng.net/). I completed my MS from the department of Computer Science as a [Deepmind Scholar](https://deepmind.google/about/education/) at the University of California, Los Angeles. 

In the past, I have spent some amazing time interning at Walmart Labs (Summer 2022), University of New Brunswick as a Mitacs Scholar (Summer 2019) and IBM Research India (2018). My  research focuses on topics including **Discourse Understanding** and  **Linguistic Evaluation of LLMs**. I am also broadly interested in **Creative Generation** and **Evaluation** using LLMs.
 
**I am applying for full-time PhD positions**! Please [email me](mailto:asuvarna31@g.ucla.edu) if you think I'm a good fit.
