I am a second-year PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at UCLA. I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Saadia Gabriel](https://saadia-gabriel.github.io/). 

My research focuses on post-training data recipes and training paradigms for improving the [reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04178) capabilities, [alignment](https://aclanthology.org/2025.findings-acl.39/) and [safety](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05455)  of LLMs. I am currently exploring recipes to develop general-purpose reasoning models and coding agents.  

I actively collaborate with other UCLA faculty, including Prof. Nanyun Peng, Prof. Kai-Wei Chang, Prof. Aditya Grover. Additionally, I work with [datacomp](https://www.datacomp.ai/) on open-source data curation (Prof. Ludwig Schimdt & Prof. Alex Dimakis).
