This is a half-baked idea for a crowdsourced art project (if you are looking for [my research](https://asuvarna31.github.io/pubs/)). Inspired by [this](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-Z0FVo6oRq1WCxp8JKXMFfPDJ0Lf9Sj-/view) and [this](https://thetapstories.com/category/comics/comics-about-women-empowerment/) and [this](https://x.com/suvarna_ashima/status/1789950678875410727). While highlighting the challenges and struggles faced by women, especially in STEM is important, it is also important to celebrate womanhood. Of course it's inspirational to be a grander than life hero but it's relatable to be a fallible woman who still functions successfully in her chosen roles. I invite you to [share short stories](https://forms.gle/dDtQHR9eN71jhvu27) or artifacts that emphasizes your womanhood. I plan to illustrate them as small (amateurishly drawn) comics.
