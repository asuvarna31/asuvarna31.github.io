<h1>SheFrames</h1>

**SheFrames** is a crowdsourced art project (you can find my research [here](https://asuvarna31.github.io/pubs/)). Inspired by [this](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-Z0FVo6oRq1WCxp8JKXMFfPDJ0Lf9Sj-/view) and [this](https://thetapstories.com/category/comics/comics-about-women-empowerment/) and [this](https://x.com/suvarna_ashima/status/1789950678875410727).

Every woman’s journey in STEM is unique, and so is the way we celebrate our femininity while thriving in these spaces. Whether it’s through small daily rituals, bold expressions, or quiet moments of self-connection, your story matters. 

How do you celebrate your womanhood in your daily life as a scientist, engineer, researcher, or professional? What small or big rituals, choices, or moments help you stay connected to your identity as a woman while breaking barriers in STEM?

I’m inviting you to share your experiences and insights by filling out this [short form](https://forms.gle/dDtQHR9eN71jhvu27). It’s a space to celebrate yourself, connect with others, and contribute to a larger celebration of womanhood. I plan to illustrate them as small comics and share them on this page.
